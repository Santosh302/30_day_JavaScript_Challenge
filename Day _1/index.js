/*  Variable and Data Types  */

/*  Tasks/Activities  */

/*  Activity 1: Variable Declaration  */


/*  Task 1: Declare a variable using var, assign it a number, and log the value to the console.*/
var i=10;
console.log(i);

/* Task 2: Declare a variable using let, assign it a string, and log the value to the console.*/
var a="Hi Santosh";
console.log(a);


/*  Activity 2: constant Declaration */

/*  Tasks 3: Declare a variablel using const, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console. */



 /* Activity 3: Data Types */ 
 /* Task 4: Create variable of different data types(number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using the typeof operator. */ 


 /* Activity 4: Reassigning Variables */ 
 /* Task 5: Declare a variable using let, assign it an inital value, reassign a new value, and log both value to the console. */


/* Activity 5: Understanding const */  
/* Task 6: Try reassigning a variable declared with const and observe the error. */


/* Feature Request:  */
/* Variable Types Console log: Write a script that variable of different data types and log both the value and type of each variable to the console.*/
/* Reassignment Demo: Create a script that demonstrates the differents in behavior between let and const when it comes to reassignment. */


/* Achievement */

* Know how to declare variable using var, let, const.
* Understand the different data types in JavaScript.
*Be able to use the typeof operator to identify the data type of a variable.
*Understand the concept of variable reassignment and the immutability of const variables.
