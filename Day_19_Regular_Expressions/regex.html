<!-- A regular expression (regex or regexp) in JavaScript is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. This pattern can be used to match sequences of characters within strings. Regular expressions are powerful tools for string manipulation, allowing you to search, replace, and validate strings in various ways.

Basic Syntax
Literals:
Regular expressions are usually created using two forward slashes / as delimiters. For example: /abc/.
Flags:
Flags are optional modifiers that affect the search. They are placed after the closing /.
g: Global search (finds all matches, not just the first).
i: Case-insensitive search.
m: Multi-line search.
s: Allows . to match newline characters.
u: Enables full Unicode matching.
y: Performs a "sticky" search that matches from the last index position. -->
